This is a simple batch file that executes a program on Windows using Python 3.
In order to use this program on your machine, you'll need to download this folder and redirect the command in the batch file to the location of the folder.

You'll also find it useful to add this folder to your Environment Variables and PATH so that all you'll need to run it is:

Windows + R, then 'hello Name'

The script also takes one argument, "Name", which can follow the cmd that executes the batch file.
